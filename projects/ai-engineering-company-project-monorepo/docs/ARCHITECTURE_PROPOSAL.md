# TrackFlow Backend — Architecture Proposal

- **Author:** Armon Nasiri
- **Status:** Draft for CTO review, before the next sprint
- **Scope:** the first backend to live under `./services/`, plus the
  shape it should take as more services land
- **Company context:** [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) is the source of
  truth; the reasoning below refers back to it constantly

## 1. What TrackFlow actually is (as it shapes architecture)

Facts that come straight from [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) and
directly constrain the architecture:

1. **Multi-tenant SaaS.** Every request is scoped to a tenant.
   Cross-tenant data must never leak.
2. **Three very different user classes** with different latency /
   ergonomics needs:
   - Warehouse operators on handheld scanners (bursty writes,
     high tolerance for offline-then-sync).
   - Dispatchers on desktop (real-time reads, dashboards).
   - Account managers on desktop (long-form flows, quoting on
     live customer calls).
3. **Distinct bounded contexts** — Shipments, Routes, Warehouses,
   Drivers, Tenants, Incidents, Pricing (freight-quote). Each has
   its own lifecycle, invariants, and consumers.
4. **A canonical business-logic package already exists** —
   `@trackflow/business-logic` (Milestone 2). Rule `MONO-1` locks
   its formula (freight quote, service-tier eligibility, currency)
   as the one authoritative implementation. **The backend must
   consume it, never reimplement it.**
5. **Two countries, MX and ES**, two currencies (MXN / EUR),
   distinct timezones. Everything user-visible has to render in
   the tenant's country and timezone; everything internal is UTC.
6. **Volume shape:** hundreds to low thousands of shipments per
   tenant per day today, with a small number of large tenants.
   Not internet-scale. Not millions of concurrent users.

Together these facts favour **a modular monolith organised by
bounded context, deployed as one FastAPI service**, with a clean
seam toward future extraction. See §2 for why we're not choosing
the alternatives.

---

## 2. Chosen pattern — Modular Monolith (Package by Feature) with a thin Layered spine

The pattern has two axes:

- **Coarse split (top-level):** package-by-feature. One directory
  per bounded context (`shipments/`, `routes/`, `warehouses/`,
  `drivers/`, `tenants/`, `incidents/`, `pricing/`).
- **Fine split (inside each feature):** thin layered separation —
  `router`, `service`, `repository`, `schemas`, `models` — because
  a FastAPI handler that does everything inline becomes untestable
  the moment a real database and background jobs land.

This is the pattern the FastAPI community converges on for
production apps that outgrow the tutorial (see §5).

### 2.1 Why not raw MVC?

MVC is fine for a single-domain CRUD app, but TrackFlow has ≥ six
distinct domains today. In an MVC layout every model would sit
under `models/`, every route under `routes/`, and reading a single
feature would mean jumping between five folders. That drift got
punished on the reference project we spent 4 milestones on — the
sample dashboard's backend collapsed everything into one 392-line
`routes.py` and every change touched the same file. Package-by-
feature is what stops that.

### 2.2 Why not microservices?

- **Team size doesn't justify it.** Microservices need per-service
  CI, deploy, on-call, observability, and cross-service contract
  tests. We are one team.
- **The bounded contexts share a database today.** A shipment's
  route lookup, a driver's tenant lookup, a warehouse's country
  lookup — these are joins, not RPCs. Cutting a network boundary
  where a foreign key belongs is the classic distributed-monolith
  trap.
- **Extraction is cheap if the modular monolith is honest.** If
  `incidents/` grows into a service later, we lift the folder and
  its router; the internal contract is already the same shape as
  an HTTP contract because inside each feature we already talk
  through a `service.py` seam (not by reaching into another
  feature's models).

### 2.3 Why not serverless (Lambda-style)?

Warehouse handheld scanners talk in bursts of writes; account
managers hold quoting sessions open. Both benefit from a warm
process and a live DB connection pool. Cold-start latency and
per-invocation billing hurt more than they help at our current
scale. Revisit only if a specific subsystem (e.g. incident
webhooks) turns into a genuine spiky event source.

### 2.4 Consequence

The team makes decisions **inside** a feature freely and pays a
review-tax when a change crosses features (services calling other
services, or a new cross-cutting middleware). That's the trade
we want: local speed, global discipline.

### 2.5 Why Python / FastAPI specifically

- **FastAPI is the course's chosen framework** and the one the
  team is upskilling on. Picking anything else here would burn
  the ramp-up already paid for.
- **Native async support** means one process can hold many
  in-flight requests without the thread-per-request tax — good
  fit for dispatcher dashboards that hold long-poll / SSE
  connections alongside warehouse-scanner bursts.
- **Pydantic-first schemas** give us request validation,
  response serialization, and OpenAPI generation from the same
  type declarations — the frontends already consume typed
  responses (see `uis/backoffice` in Milestone 4), so parity of
  types across the wire is essentially free.
- **Automatic `/docs` (Swagger UI)** and `/redoc` mean the
  frontend team never asks "what does this endpoint return" —
  the contract is the code.

## 3. Proposed folder and module structure

New backend service under `./services/api/` (name matches
convention set by the existing README hint —
`services/admin-api` in `services/README.md`; we'll use `api`
since it's the first and only backend surface today).

```

### 3.1 Separation criteria (why files land where they do)

- **A file that names an HTTP concept** (path, status code, request
  body shape) belongs in `router.py` or `schemas.py`.
- **A file that names a business concept** (rules, invariants,
  workflows across resources) belongs in `service.py`.
- **A file that names a persistence concept** (SQL, indices,
  ORM classes) belongs in `repository.py` / `models.py`.
- **Shared code moves to `shared/` only when it is used by ≥ 2
  features and does not encode domain knowledge.** Domain
  knowledge stays in the feature that owns it (rule `MONO-1`'s
  spirit applied inside a service).

### 3.2 What NOT to add to `shared/`

`shared/` is not a junk drawer. Anti-examples:

- A `format_currency` helper — currency formatting depends on the
  tenant's country; that belongs in the `pricing/` or `tenants/`
  feature, not in a shared file that grows into a
  business-rule dumping ground.
- A `Shipment` type — that's `shipments/schemas.py`.

### 3.3 Testing layout (mirrors the source)

Tests live under `services/api/tests/`, with the same folder
shape as the source so a reviewer opening `shipments/service.py`
knows to check `tests/shipments/test_service.py`. The pyramid:

- **Unit tests** on `service.py` and helpers in `shared/` — no DB,
  no HTTP, no network. Fast.
- **Repository tests** on `repository.py` — hit a **real**
  Postgres (test-container in CI), never a mock. Mocks here
  historically hide join / transaction / migration bugs (learned
  the hard way on prior projects — see rule `TEST-1` in
  `.agents/rules/`).
- **HTTP tests** on `router.py` via `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`
  — cover routing, auth dependencies, validation, response
  shape.
- **Contract tests** on `pricing/` specifically — run
  `.agents/skills/freight-quote-invariants/scripts/verify.mjs`
  in CI whenever a file under `pricing/` changes (rule `MONO-1`
  guardrail).

### 3.4 Where the freight-quote formula lives

**Not here.** The `pricing/` feature is a *bridge* — it accepts an
HTTP request, validates it with Pydantic, and delegates to the
already-existing `@trackflow/business-logic` package (Milestone 2)
via a subprocess boundary or a small Python port kept 1:1 with
that module. Rule `MONO-1` forbids a parallel Python implementation.

Two viable options for the bridge, both compatible with this
architecture:

| Option                            | Pros                                     | Cons                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. Call Node via subprocess**   | Zero drift — one implementation.         | Cold-start + serialization overhead per call.     |
| **B. Regenerate a Python mirror** | Fastest at request time.                 | Two implementations — must be kept in sync via `freight-quote-invariants` skill. |

Recommendation: start with **A** (call Node) for correctness. If
p95 latency at the pricing endpoint exceeds ~150ms in load
testing, revisit with a Python mirror plus a mandatory sync-check
CI job that runs `.agents/skills/freight-quote-invariants/scripts/verify.mjs`
against both.

---

## 4. FastAPI endpoint / router organisation

### 4.1 Grouping

- **One `APIRouter` per bounded context**, defined in that feature's
  `router.py`. Included by `main.py` with a URL prefix and a tag:

  ```python
  # sketch, not code to run
  app.include_router(shipments.router, prefix="/api/v1/shipments", tags=["Shipments"])
  app.include_router(routes.router,    prefix="/api/v1/routes",    tags=["Routes"])
  app.include_router(pricing.router,   prefix="/api/v1/pricing",   tags=["Pricing"])
  # ... one line per feature
  ```

- **URL version prefix is `/api/v1`.** A version segment is cheap
  now and buys us a clean off-ramp when the mobile driver app
  needs a breaking change we can't backport.

### 4.2 Route inventory (illustrative — actual endpoints follow the
same grouping)

| Prefix                       | Endpoint                              | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/v1/health`             | `GET /`                               | Liveness — kubernetes / uptime checks.                   |
| `/api/v1/shipments`          | `POST /`                              | Create a shipment (multi-tenant scoped).                 |
| `/api/v1/shipments`          | `GET /`                               | List shipments (paginated, filterable).                  |
| `/api/v1/shipments`          | `GET /{shipment_id}`                  | Detail.                                                  |
| `/api/v1/shipments`          | `PATCH /{shipment_id}/status`         | Warehouse operator progress updates.                     |
| `/api/v1/routes`             | `POST /`, `GET /`, `POST /{id}/assign` | Dispatch flows.                                          |
| `/api/v1/drivers`            | `GET /`, `POST /`, `PATCH /{id}`      | Driver management.                                       |
| `/api/v1/warehouses`         | `GET /`, `POST /`                     | Warehouse configuration by tenant.                       |
| `/api/v1/tenants`            | `POST /`, `GET /me`                   | Tenant onboarding, current tenant profile.               |
| `/api/v1/incidents`          | `POST /`, `GET /`, `PATCH /{id}`      | Incident capture and resolution.                         |
| `/api/v1/pricing`            | `POST /quote`                         | Freight quote — delegates to `@trackflow/business-logic`.|

### 4.3 Grouping rule for new endpoints

If a new endpoint is about **one** noun in the vocabulary above,
it goes into that feature's `router.py`. If it genuinely spans
two, it belongs in a new feature (e.g. an `incidents-on-a-route`
correlation report is a new `reporting/` feature, not a route
crammed into `routes/`).

## 5. What the FastAPI community actually does (research, cited)

Three references shaped this proposal. Each one is named below,
with the specific convention it contributed and the section of
this document where the convention shows up. That mapping is the
audit trail: nothing in our folder tree or router setup is a
personal preference — it traces back to a source.

### 5.1 Sources

1. **FastAPI Official Docs — "Bigger Applications — Multiple Files".**
   <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/>
   The canonical FastAPI guide for organising a real project.
2. **`zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices`.**
   <https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices>
   The community-maintained reference for production FastAPI
   layout; ~11k stars, quoted in most FastAPI onboarding docs.
3. **`tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template`.**
   <https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template>
   The official full-stack template maintained by FastAPI's
   author (Sebastián Ramírez / `tiangolo`).

### 5.2 Which convention came from which source

| Convention adopted here                                                 | Source                                       | Where in this doc |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| One `APIRouter` per feature; `include_router` in `main.py`              | FastAPI official — "Bigger Applications"     | §4.1              |
| App factory in `main.py` mounting CORS + routers                         | FastAPI official — "Bigger Applications"     | §3 tree, §6.2     |
| Split each feature into `router.py` / `schemas.py` / `service.py` / `repository.py` / `models.py` / `dependencies.py` | `zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices`         | §3 tree, §3.1     |
| Package **by feature** at the top, not by technical layer               | `zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices`         | §2, §3            |
| Async-first handlers, sync fallback documented                          | `zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices`         | §7.1 (below)      |
| `src/<pkg>/` src-layout                                                 | `tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template`       | §3 tree           |
| Pydantic `Settings` in `config.py`, `.env.example` mirrored             | `tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template`       | §3 tree, §6.3     |
| JWT security concentrated in a single module (`security.py`)             | `tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template`       | §3 tree, §6.1     |
| Alembic migrations at the service root                                   | `tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template`       | §7.2 (below)      |

### 5.3 Deliberate deviations

Where our proposal deviates from these references, we say so:

- **`/api/v1` versioning from day one** — the FastAPI template
  omits it. Rationale in §4.1: we already know a driver-mobile
  client is coming and will need contract breakage room.
- **`pricing/` is a thin wrapper**, not a native Python
  implementation — because the authoritative freight-quote formula
  is a JavaScript workspace (`@trackflow/business-logic`) and rule
  `MONO-1` forbids parallel implementations. See §3.4.
- **No `crud.py`** — the templates sometimes use `crud.py` for
  DB helpers; we call it `repository.py` because CRUD is a
  vocabulary of the persistence layer, not of the business, and
  most of our repositories will do more than the four CRUD verbs
  (filtered lists, aggregate reads for dispatch).

---

## 6. How frontend and backend coexist as separate systems

Already true in the monorepo today: `./uis/website` and
`./uis/backoffice` (Milestone 4) are Next.js apps, and this
proposal puts the API under `./services/api`. Same repo, separate
runtimes.

### 6.1 Communication contract

- **Transport:** HTTPS, JSON, `/api/v1/...` prefix.
- **Auth:** short-lived JWT in `Authorization: Bearer` header,
  refresh flow via HTTP-only cookie. `security.py` owns the
  Depends that resolves `current_user` and `current_tenant`; no
  handler ever touches raw tokens.
- **Tenant scoping:** the tenant id is derived from the JWT
  claim, **not** from a query parameter or a body field. This is
  what enforces the "no cross-tenant leaks" invariant in
  `CONTEXT.md`. A repository query that doesn't filter by
  `tenant_id` fails a lint rule (rule to be added: `SVC-1`).

### 6.2 CORS

- **Dev:** allow `http://localhost:3000` (`uis/website`) and
  `http://localhost:3100` (`uis/backoffice`) explicitly. Not
  `"*"` (learned that lesson on the reference dashboard —
  wildcard origin + `allow_credentials=True` is rejected by
  browsers and misrepresents the policy anyway).
- **Prod:** allow the two configured public origins from
  `settings.WEBSITE_ORIGIN` and `settings.BACKOFFICE_ORIGIN`,
  both read from env, both required (fail-fast on boot if unset).

### 6.3 Environment variables and secrets

- Every backend env var declared in `src/trackflow_api/config.py`
  via Pydantic `Settings`. Nothing else reads `os.environ`
  directly.
- `services/api/.env.example` mirrors that class one-to-one; CI
  fails if the two drift.
- Frontends use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` pointing at
  `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` in dev and the deployed origin
  in prod. Set per app via each app's `.env.local` (never
  committed).

### 6.4 Deploy shape

Two independent artifacts, same repo:

- Backend container: `services/api/Dockerfile` → one image.
- Frontends: each `uis/*` gets its own Vercel-style deploy.

Coupling stays at the API contract. A backend deploy does not
require a frontend redeploy (except when the OpenAPI schema
changes shape — that goes through the versioning gate in §4.1).

### 6.5 Repo layout — monorepo vs. split (explicit trade)

The brief specifically asks us to consider the trade-off. Here it
is, in one table, ending with our call and the reversal criterion.

| Dimension                | **Monorepo** (chosen)                                        | **Split repos** (rejected for now)                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared code (`packages/business-logic`) | Imported directly by workspace resolution.                   | Requires a private registry + release cadence per change.      |
| Atomic cross-cutting change (rename a domain field) | One PR, one review, one CI run.                              | N PRs, dependency version bumps, coordination overhead.       |
| CI cost                  | One matrix, cached workspaces.                               | N pipelines, N caches.                                        |
| Independent deploys      | Yes — each workspace has its own Dockerfile / Vercel project. | Yes.                                                          |
| Access control granularity | Repo-wide (fine at our team size).                          | Per-repo (needed only at multi-team scale).                    |
| Onboarding a new engineer | One clone, one `npm install`.                                | N clones, credential setup per repo.                           |

**Decision.** Monorepo, matching what the repo already is.
Revisit only when (a) an outside team needs write access to one
service but not others, or (b) CI wall-clock exceeds ~15 minutes
per commit. Neither is close today.

### 6.6 What each side owns at the boundary

Codifying who is responsible for what, to prevent the classic
"backend returns raw numbers but frontend forgot to format them
per country" bug:

- **Backend owns:** all business logic, all persistence, all
  authorization, all validation of inbound data, and the OpenAPI
  schema. Returns raw numbers + currency codes (never `"$"`),
  ISO-8601 UTC timestamps.
- **Frontend owns:** the whole rendering layer — currency
  formatting per tenant country, timezone conversion, empty /
  loading / error states, accessibility. Never invents domain
  rules; if it needs one, it calls the backend or reads
  `@trackflow/business-logic`.
- **Contract:** the generated OpenAPI schema + the Pydantic
  models. Any change to a response shape is a schema change, and
  a schema change either bumps `/api/v1` → `/api/v2` (breaking)
  or is additive-only (non-breaking).

## 7. Concrete technical decisions

Explicit choices that a new hire would otherwise have to guess.
None contradict the course content; each names the alternative
it beats and the reversal signal.

### 7.1 Async-first, sync where needed

- **Every route handler is `async def`** by default. FastAPI's
  event loop can hold many in-flight requests per worker.
- **DB access uses `SQLAlchemy 2.0` async** (`AsyncSession`)
  where the driver supports it (`asyncpg`). If a specific
  query is easier expressed sync, wrap it in
  `run_in_threadpool()` — do not block the loop.
- **Reversal signal:** if p95 latency stalls on sync-only I/O
  we haven't isolated, drop to sync + gunicorn workers per
  request; this trades throughput for simplicity.

### 7.2 Persistence: PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic

- **PostgreSQL 16** — one shared DB, `tenant_id` on every row,
  RLS (row-level security) policies as a defence-in-depth layer
  behind the repository-layer filter (see risk R3).
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** ORM in `models.py`; queries in
  `repository.py`. No raw SQL scattered across handlers.
- **Alembic migrations** at `services/api/alembic/`, one
  migration per PR that touches a `models.py`. Migrations run
  automatically as an init container in CI/staging, manually
  gated in prod.
- **Not chosen:** Django ORM (framework mismatch),
  Tortoise / Piccolo (smaller ecosystems), MongoDB (relational
  data with strict tenant boundaries — the wrong shape).

### 7.3 AuthN / AuthZ

- **AuthN:** short-lived JWT (15 min) in `Authorization: Bearer`,
  HTTP-only rotating refresh cookie. Issuer: **self-hosted**
  first (`security.py` handles issue + verify), with a documented
  migration path to a hosted provider (WorkOS, Clerk, Auth0)
  when SSO becomes a customer requirement.
- **AuthZ:** every endpoint uses `Depends(current_tenant)`;
  cross-tenant reads are impossible by construction because
  `tenant_id` is derived server-side from the JWT claim and
  passed into every repository call.

### 7.4 Observability

- **Structured JSON logs** to stdout via `structlog` (one line per
  request with `trace_id`, `tenant_id`, `route`, `status`,
  `latency_ms`).
- **OpenTelemetry** for traces exported to whichever backend the
  ops team picks (Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, Datadog — decision
  deferred, does not affect code shape).
- **Metrics:** `prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator` at
  `/metrics` scraped by whatever runs the deploy target.

### 7.5 Deployment target

- **Container-first.** `services/api/Dockerfile` produces one
  image, published on merge to `main`.
- **Runtime:** whichever container platform the ops team
  standardises on (Fly.io / Render / a small Kubernetes cluster
  are all fine for our volume shape). The architecture doesn't
  depend on the choice.
- **Frontends:** each `uis/*` deploys independently via its
  hosting platform's Next.js pipeline (Vercel default).
- **Rollback:** container image tags are immutable; rollback is
  a redeploy of the previous tag, not a git revert.

### 7.6 CI gates (before any PR merges)

1. `npm run typecheck` + `npm run test` at the monorepo root
   (already established by AGENTS.md § 2).
2. `pytest` inside `services/api/` — unit + repo + HTTP tests.
3. `alembic upgrade head` against a throwaway Postgres — proves
   the migration graph applies from scratch.
4. `.agents/skills/freight-quote-invariants/scripts/verify.mjs`
   whenever `services/api/src/trackflow_api/pricing/` changed
   (enforces rule `MONO-1`).
5. Docker image builds and passes a `curl /health` smoke test.

## 8. Risks and points of attention

At least two, per the brief — six here because they're the ones
most likely to cause real pain if the team doesn't follow the
structure above.

### R1 — The `shared/` folder becomes a business-logic dumping ground

**What goes wrong:** it's the easiest place to drop code, so people
do. Six months in, `shared/utils.py` is 800 lines, half the
project imports it, and a change to a "shared helper" silently
alters four features.
**Guardrail:** every file added to `shared/` requires a PR
description sentence saying which ≥ 2 features consume it and
naming why the code isn't domain-owned. If neither is true, the
file belongs inside a feature.

### R2 — Business logic drifts from `@trackflow/business-logic`

**What goes wrong:** a developer, tired of the Node subprocess
call in `pricing/service.py`, quietly ports the freight-quote
formula to Python "just for this endpoint". Two implementations,
one wrong; sales quotes and invoices disagree.
**Guardrail:** rule `MONO-1` already forbids it, and
`.agents/skills/freight-quote-invariants/` gives a runnable
check. Add a CI job that runs
`npm run verify:freight-quote` on every PR that touches
`services/api/src/trackflow_api/pricing/`.

### R3 — Tenant scoping enforced in handlers instead of repositories

**What goes wrong:** the first version of `shipments/service.py`
does `db.query(Shipment).all()` and filters by `tenant_id` in
Python. The next handler forgets the filter and returns every
tenant's shipments in one JSON response.
**Guardrail:** all queries live in `repository.py`, and the
repository takes a `tenant_id` as a required argument — no
overload without it. This is a testable invariant; a lint rule
(`SVC-1`) can enforce that no `db.query(...).all()` /
`select(Model)` appears outside `repository.py`.

### R4 — Cross-feature imports (`shipments/` → `routes/models.py`)

**What goes wrong:** the moment `shipments/service.py` does
`from trackflow_api.routes.models import Route`, we've created
a coupling that will fight future extraction and make circular
imports likely.
**Guardrail:** features may import from `shared/`, from their own
`schemas.py` / `service.py`, and — grudgingly — from another
feature's public **schemas**, never its `models.py`. Cross-feature
behaviour goes through the other feature's `service.py`
function (the same seam we'd hit if it were a separate service).

### R5 — Timezone / currency handled ad-hoc in the API layer

**What goes wrong:** a handler formats currency directly in a
response by hard-coding `"$"`. A Spanish tenant sees a dollar
sign. A dispatcher in Mexico sees a UTC timestamp on their
shift roster.
**Guardrail:** currency formatting only happens in the UI layer
(the API returns raw numbers + currency code); timestamps are
always ISO-8601 UTC in the API; the tenant's country and
timezone live on the JWT and are applied in the UI. Two
`shared/` files (`money.py`, `datetime_utils.py`) exist only to
enforce this at the boundary and are the *only* helpers allowed
to touch either concern.

### R6 — Observability deferred until "we need it"

**What goes wrong:** structlog and the OpenTelemetry hooks in
§7.4 are trivial to add on day one, hard to retrofit after the
first production incident. If we ship without them, we'll
diagnose the first outage from Cloudflare logs and guesses.
**Guardrail:** the first PR that adds a real handler under
`services/api/` must also add the log middleware, the
`prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator` mount, and the OTLP exporter
wiring — even if the collector endpoint is a no-op in dev.
Reviewers block otherwise.

## 9. Summary — one paragraph for the CTO

TrackFlow is a mid-market, multi-tenant SaaS with a handful of
distinct bounded contexts, and its authoritative business logic
already lives in `@trackflow/business-logic`. The right backend
shape for that is a **modular monolith organised by feature**,
built on **FastAPI + async SQLAlchemy 2.0 + PostgreSQL + Alembic**,
with an internal seam per feature
(`router`/`service`/`repository`/`schemas`/`models`) that mirrors
the community reference layouts (`zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices`,
FastAPI's own "Bigger Applications" guide, and
`tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template`). URLs are versioned
under `/api/v1`; frontends and backend coexist in the monorepo
(explicit trade in §6.5) but ship as independent Docker /
Next.js artefacts with explicit CORS origins and env-var-declared
secrets. The main risks are all discipline risks — `shared/`
bloat, business-logic drift, tenant-scope leaks, cross-feature
import creep, ad-hoc formatting, and deferred observability —
and each has a named guardrail above.
