## The company

**TrackFlow** is a last-mile delivery and warehousing SaaS operating
in **Mexico** and **Spain**. It sells to mid-market retailers and
regional logistics operators. The product is used by three kinds of
people:

- **Warehouse operators** — pick, pack, and load shipments; work on
  handheld scanners inside a warehouse. Their screens must be legible
  under bad lighting and usable with gloves.
- **Dispatchers** — assign routes to drivers, monitor delayed
  shipments, respond to incidents. Work at a desktop.
- **Account managers** (TrackFlow employees) — onboard new retailers,
  configure their tenants, run pricing quotes with customers on
  video calls. Work in a browser, need fast round-trips.

## Domain vocabulary (canonical)

Use these names verbatim in code, schemas, and copy. Do not
paraphrase.

| Concept          | Definition                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shipment**     | A parcel or set of parcels moving from one origin to one destination under a single tracking id. |
| **Route**        | An ordered sequence of Shipments assigned to a Driver for a single working day.                  |
| **Driver**       | A person authorised to execute a Route. Each Driver belongs to exactly one Warehouse.            |
| **Warehouse**    | A physical location where shipments enter, are sorted, and depart. Has a country (`MX` / `ES`). |
| **Tenant**       | A retailer or operator paying for TrackFlow. Tenants have their own users, warehouses, drivers, and pricing agreement. |
| **Service tier** | Contractual promise: `standard` (48 h), `express` (24 h), `priority` (same-day, MX metros only). |
| **Zone**         | Geographic grouping used for pricing. Metro / regional / remote.                                 |
| **Incident**     | Anything that stops a Shipment from meeting its Service tier promise (address error, damaged, refused, etc.). |

## Constraints and non-negotiables

- **Units**: distances in **kilometres**, weights in **kilograms**,
  prices in **EUR** for ES tenants and **MXN** for MX tenants —
  never pesos-as-USD, never miles.
- **Time**: everything internal is stored in UTC and rendered in the
  tenant's warehouse timezone. Dates as ISO-8601 `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Tenant isolation**: no cross-tenant data ever leaves the API for
  a request scoped to a tenant. There is no "global" view of
  shipments across tenants for anyone outside TrackFlow ops.
- **Priority tier**: only available for Shipments whose origin **and**
  destination Zones are both `metro` **and** country `MX`.
- **Freight quote formula (Milestone 2 business logic)** —
  authoritative implementation lives in
  [`packages/business-logic/src/freight-quote.ts`](./packages/business-logic/src/freight-quote.ts).
  Do not duplicate this formula in the frontend or in another
  package. UIs consume the exported `quoteShipment` function.

## Out of scope for this monorepo

- Customer-facing consumer app (a shipper does not log into TrackFlow
  directly — they are notified by their retailer).
- Driver mobile app (native, lives in a separate repo).
- Anything that is not either MX or ES.
